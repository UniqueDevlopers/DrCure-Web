                    <li>Users’ personally identifiable information, which they choose to provide on the Website or App
                        is used to help the Users describe/identify themselves. Other information that does not
                        personally identify the Users as an individual, is collected by Aster or our Partners from Users
                        (such as, patterns of utilization described above) and is exclusively owned by Aster or its
                        partners. We or our Partners may also use such information in an aggregated or non-personally

                        the Services. We shall not retain such information for longer than is required for the purposes
                        for which the information may lawfully be used or is otherwise required under any other law for
                        the time being in force. After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and
                        then may be held by us or our Partners as long as necessary for us to provide our Services
                        effectively or improve the Services, but our use of the anonymized data will be solely for
                        analytic purposes.</li>
                    <li>Aster may require the User to pay with a credit card, debit card, net banking or other online
                        payment mechanisms for Services for which an amount(s) is/are payable. Aster will collect such
                        User’s credit card number and/or other financial institution information such as bank account
                        numbers and will use that information for the billing and payment processes, including but not
                        limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as
                        necessary to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is
                        accomplished solely by the User through the authentication process offered by a third-party
                        payment gateway. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of
                        approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby providing the highest
                        possible degree of care as per current technology. User is advised, however, that internet
                        technology is not full proof safe and User should exercise discretion on using the same.</li>
                    <li>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or anyone who visits the
                        Website, we automatically receive the URL of the site from which anyone visits. We also receive
                        the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s computer (or the proxy server a User used to
                        access the World Wide Web),</li>
                </ol>

                <p>User’s computer/ device operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email patterns,
                    as well as the name of User’s ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help Aster
                    improve its Service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally identifiable
                    information may be available to us or our Partners but is not shared with other third parties.
                    Notwithstanding the above, we may share some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) in
                    anonymized form (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic
                    partners, and others in order to help grow our business.</p>

                    <li>The Website may use cookies to store certain data (that is not sensitive personal data or
                        information) that is used by us and our partners for the technical administration of the
                        Website, App, research and development, and for User administration. In the course of serving
                        advertisements or optimizing services to its Users, Aster may allow authorized third parties to
                        place or recognize a unique cookie on the User’s browser. The cookies however, do not store any
                        personal information of the User.</li>
                    <li>In order to have access to all the features and benefits on our Website or App, a User must
                        first create an account on our Website or App. To create an account, a User is required to
                        provide the following information, which such User recognizes and expressly acknowledges is
                        personal information allowing others, including Aster, to identify the User: name, User ID,
                        email address, address, date of birth, gender, phone number and password chosen by the User.
                        Other optional information may be requested on the registration page. We may, in future, include
                        other optional requests for information from the User to help us to customize the Services to
                        deliver personalized information to the User. However, we assume your consent in relation to
                        various matters, once you complete the registration process.</li>
                    <li>This Privacy Policy applies to Websites, App and Services that are owned and operated by Aster.
                        We do not exercise control over the sites that may be displayed as search results or links from
                        within the Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on the Users’
                        computer, collect data or solicit personal information from the Users, for which Aster is not
                        responsible or liable. Accordingly, Aster does not make any representations concerning the
                        privacy practices or policies of such third parties or terms of use of such websites, nor does
                        Aster guarantee the accuracy, integrity, or quality of the information, data, text, software,
                        sound, photographs, graphics, videos, messages or other materials available on such websites.
                        The inclusion or exclusion of such other sites does not imply any endorsement by Aster of the
                        website, the website's provider, or the information on the website. If you decide to visit a
                        third-party website linked to the Aster Website, you do this entirely at your own risk. Aster
                        encourages the User to read the privacy policies of that website.</li>
                    <li>The Services may enable a User to communicate with other Users or to post information to be
                        accessed by others, whereupon other Users may collect such data. Aster hereby expressly
                        disclaims any liability for any reliance or misuse</li>
                </ol>

                <p>of such information that is made available by Users or visitors in such a manner.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Aster may periodically ask users to complete surveys asking about their experiences with
                        features of the Websites, App and Services. Our surveys may ask visitors for demographic
                        information such as age, gender, and education. We use survey information for evaluation and
                        quality improvement purposes, including helping Aster to improve information and services
                        offered. In addition, users giving feedback may be individually contacted for follow-up due to
                        concerns raised during the course of such evaluation. Demographic information and Web log data
                        may be stored for future evaluation and quality improvement activities.</li>
                    <li>Comments or questions sent to us using email or secure messaging forms will be shared with our
                        employees and health care professionals who are most able to address the comment or question. We
                        will archive your messages once we have made our best effort to provide you with a complete and
                        satisfactory response. Some of our services such as our automated appointment selection and
                        prescription refill for Aster generated prescriptions interact directly with other Aster data
                        systems. Data about your transaction may be stored in these systems, and available to people who
                        test and support these systems. When you use a service on the Websites or the App to interact
                        directly with Aster health care professionals, some information you provide may be documented in
                        your medical record, and available for use to guide your treatment as a patient.</li>
                    <li>Our Websites and the App may include social media Features, such as the Facebook button. These
                        Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a
                        cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Your interactions with these Features are
                        governed by the privacy statement of the company providing them.</li>
                    <li>If you are using the Websites or App, with your permission, we will use the geo-location feature
                        of your mobile device or same or similar feature of the device you are using to access the
                        Websites. When you download and use the App, we automatically collect information on the type of
                        device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier. Aster and our Partners do
                        not share your location information with other any third party. You may opt out of
                        location-based services on your mobile phone by changing the relevant/ applicable setting at
                        your device level.</li>
                    <li>Aster does not collect information about the visitors of the Website from other sources, such as
                        public records or bodies, or private organisations, save and except for the purposes of
                        registration of the Users (the collection, storage and disclosure of which each User must agree
                        to under the terms of use in order for Aster to effectively render the Services).</li>
                    <li>Aster has implemented best standard industry practices and security policies, rules and
                        technical measures to protect the personal data that it has under its control from unauthorised
                        access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification and unlawful destruction or
                        accidental loss. However, for any data loss or theft due to unauthorized access to the User’s
                        electronic devices</li>
                </ol>

                <p>through which the User avails the Services, Aster or its Partners shall not be held liable for any
                    loss whatsoever incurred by the User.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Aster ensures it and its partners implement reasonable security practices and procedures that
                        are commensurate with respect to the information being collected and the nature of Aster’s
                        business. The reasonable security practices and procedures implemented by us include but are not
                        limited to: encrypting data when it is on the move using industry standard practices, regularly
                        changing production keys and password, secure access to all production servers, performing
                        regular security updates on our servers and more.</li>
                    <li>Aster takes your right to privacy very seriously and other than as specifically stated in this
                        privacy Policy, will only disclose your personal information in the event it is required to do
                        so by law, rule, regulation, law enforcement agency, governmental official, legal authority or
                        similar requirements or when Aster, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary in order to
                        protect its rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight
                        fraud and credit risk, or to enforce or apply the Terms of Use.</li>
                    <li>Aster may also disclose or transfer End-Users’ personal and other information a User provides,
                        to a third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of a Aster division or
                        company. Any third party to which Aster transfers or sells its assets to will have the right to
                        continue to use the personal and other information that Users provide to us, in accordance with
                        the Terms of Use.</li>
                    <li>To the extent necessary to provide Users with the Services, Aster may provide their personal
                        information to third party contractors who work on behalf of or with Aster to provide Users with
                        such Services, to help Aster communicate with Users or to maintain the Website or App. Generally
                        these contractors do not have any independent right to share this information, however certain
                        contractors who provide services on the Website, including the providers of online
                        communications services, will have rights to use and disclose the personal information collected
                        in connection with the provision of these Services in accordance with their own privacy
                        policies.</li>
